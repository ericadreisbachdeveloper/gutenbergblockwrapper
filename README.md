This is a simple plugin that conditioanlly adds custom `<div>` wrappers around Gutenberg blocks to programmatically allow design to function within the constraints of native Wordpress development. Specifically, this plugin was originally written to allow the first content block on a page to span the full screen width if it is a `Cover` block.
